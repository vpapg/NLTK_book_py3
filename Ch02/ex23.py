# Zipf's Law: Let f(w) be the frequency of a word w in free text. Suppose that all the words of a text are ranked according to their frequency, with the most frequent word first. Zipf's law states that the frequency of a word type is inversely proportional to its rank (i.e. f × r = k, for some constant k). For example, the 50th most common word type should occur three times as frequently as the 150th most common word type.
#
# a. Write a function to process a large text and plot word frequency against word rank using pylab.plot. Do you confirm Zipf's law? (Hint: it helps to use a logarithmic scale). What is going on at the extreme ends of the plotted line?
#
# b. Generate random text, e.g., using random.choice("abcdefg "), taking care to include the space character. You will need to import random first. Use the string concatenation operator to accumulate characters into a (very) long string. Then tokenize this string, and generate the Zipf plot as before, and compare the two plots. What do you make of Zipf's Law in the light of this?
